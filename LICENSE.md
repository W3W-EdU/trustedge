## 2. Order Forms; Portal.

*2.1* *Order Forms.*  Customer may purchase specific Services from DigiCert by entering into one or more mutually agreed upon quotes, purchase schedules, purchase orders, or order forms (whether online or electronic) that set forth the specific Services being procured by Customer under this Agreement, the term when each such Service is to be provided by DigiCert (the "**Service Term**") and the related payment terms for such Service (each, an "**Order Form**").

Customer and DigiCert acknowledge and agree that each Order Form will be governed by and incorporated by reference into the terms of this Agreement.

*2.2* *Portal; Portal API.*  Subject to Customer's compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, DigiCert hereby grants Customer permission, during the term of this Agreement, to use the Portal (if, and in the form made available by DigiCert to Customer) to manage Services to the extent permitted in the Portal. Further, subject to Customer's compliance with this Agreement, if Customer has been granted access to the Portal API by DigiCert, then DigiCert hereby grants to Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, limited license during the term of this Agreement to install, use and make calls to and from such Portal API solely for the purpose of facilitating Customer's use of the Portal (and its tools and functionalities) directly from Customer's internal systems. DigiCert may throttle any access to the Portal or Portal API if DigiCert believes a system has initiated excessive connections to DigiCert's Portals or Portal API or as DigiCert otherwise deems it necessary to protect DigiCert's technology systems. DigiCert reserves the right to block an IP address that has been used to initiate connections that are not related to normal use of services, or as DigiCert otherwise deems it necessary to protect DigiCert's technology systems. Examples of non-normal use connections include, but are not limited to, vulnerability or load/performance scans.

*2.3* *Portal Accounts.*  In connection with certain applicable Services, DigiCert will provide the Customer with accounts to access and use the Portal (the "**Portal Accounts**").

If Customer purchases QTSP Services, the QTSP will be responsible to perform the QTSP Services.

*2.5* *Purchases for Resale.*  If Customer purchases Services not for itself, its Affiliates, or their employees or contractors but for resale, then Customer agrees that such purchases will be governed by the terms of the Master Partner Agreement, available at https://www.digicert.com/master-partner-agreement (as updated from time to time), which terms are incorporated herein by reference.

*2.6* *Purchase through or as a Procuring Party.*  If Customer purchases or uses the Services through a Procuring Party, then Customer hereby represents and warrants that Customer has authorized such Procuring Party to apply for, accept, install, maintain, renew and, if necessary, revoke the Services on Customer's behalf. By authorizing a Procuring Party to provide or resell the Services to Customer, Customer hereby affirms its acceptance of this Agreement as it relates to Customer's use of the Services. If Customer is accessing or using the Services on behalf of a business, entity, or individual (as a Procuring Party or otherwise), then: (a) it represents and warrants that *(i)* it is an authorized representative of such business, entity, or individual, with the authority to bind the business, entity, or individual to this Agreement, and *(ii)* it will comply with and procure the applicable party's compliance with this Agreement; and (b) such business, entity, or individual is the "Customer" hereunder and is legally and financially responsible for access to and use of the Services as well as for the use of the account by others, including any employees, agents or contractors.

## 3. Fees.

*3.1* *Fees.*  Customer will pay DigiCert the fees for Services provided hereunder pursuant to the latest pricing posted in the Portal or as set forth in an Order Form. All payments are due and payable either within 30 days of the date of purchase or such other period, if any, stated in an Order Form. Fees payable hereunder are in exchange for the provision of Services by DigiCert and are not a royalty or license fee. If Customer submits funds to its Portal Account that are not connected to an Order Form (i.e., funds not connected to the purchase of Services with a definite term length), Customer may use such funds to purchase Services within 12 months. If Customer fails to use all such funds, any remaining funds will be deemed fees earned by DigiCert for Services provided, and Customer may not use them in connection with any other purchase. If any undisputed invoiced amount is not received by DigiCert by the due date, then without limiting DigiCert's rights or remedies, (a) those charges will accrue late interest at the rate of 1.5% of the outstanding balance per month, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, (b) DigiCert may accelerate Customer's unpaid fee obligations so that they become immediately due and payable, and (c) DigiCert may suspend or limit Customer's access to the Portal or Services without notice until full payment is made. Customer must notify DigiCert of any fee disputes within 30 days of the applicable invoice date or such invoice will be deemed accepted. If Customer has purchased the Services through a Procuring Party, the payment terms will be those terms established between Customer and such Procuring Party. If Customer or an applicable Procuring Party does not pay the applicable fees for any Services extended to Customer, then DigiCert may suspend or limit Customer's access to the Portal or Services without notice until full payment is made.

*3.2* *Taxes.*  DigiCert may charge, and Customer will pay, all applicable federal, state, or local sales or use taxes, value added taxes ("**VAT**"), goods and services taxes ("**GST**"), and consumption taxes that DigiCert is legally obligated to charge ("**Taxes**"). All fees charged by DigiCert are exclusive of any Taxes however imposed, e.g., VAT, GST, or consumption taxes, unless such Taxes are stated on the invoice DigiCert provides to Customer. Customer may provide DigiCert an exemption certificate or equivalent information acceptable to the relevant taxing authority. In such case, DigiCert will not charge or collect the Taxes covered by such exemption certificate. If the tax status of Customer were to change from tax-exempt to taxable during the term of this Agreement, Customer shall notify DigiCert of this change within thirty (30) days. If Customer fails to notify DigiCert, then Customer shall be solely responsible for any unpaid Taxes resulting from fees paid to DigiCert. During the term of this Agreement, DigiCert will provide Customer with forms, documents, or certifications as may be required for Customer to satisfy information reporting or withholding tax obligations with respect to payments under this Agreement. Upon DigiCert's receipt of Customer's proof of legally required withholding (which proof must be acceptable in DigiCert's sole discretion), Customer may only deduct or withhold any Taxes that DigiCert and Customer determine Customer is legally obligated to withhold from any amounts payable to DigiCert under this Agreement. Except as stated in this Section 3.2, Customer may not withhold or offset any amount owed to DigiCert for any reason.

## 4. Intellectual Property Rights; Restrictions.

*4.1* *DigiCert Intellectual Property Rights.*  DigiCert and its applicable licensors retain, and Customer will not obtain or claim, any title, interest, or ownership rights in any of DigiCert's products or services, including all software associated with the Portal, the On-Premises Software, any other Services, or techniques and ideas embedded therein; all updates, improvements, enhancements, modifications, copies or derivative works of such products or services or software provided by DigiCert, regardless of who produced, requested, or suggested the updates, improvements, enhancements, modifications, copies or derivative works; all Documentation and marketing material provided by DigiCert to Customer; and all of DigiCert's copyrights, patent rights, trade secret rights and other proprietary rights.

DigiCert may terminate this Agreement or Customer's Portal Accounts, or restrict Customer's access to the Services, if DigiCert reasonably believes that Customer is using the Services to post or make accessible any material that infringes DigiCert's or any third party's rights or is in breach of this Agreement. Customer will not use any marketing material or Documentation that refers to DigiCert or its products or services without receiving written prior approval from DigiCert, except as may be set forth in any Service Specific Terms.

*4.3* *Feedback.*  If Customer provides DigiCert with any Feedback related to the Services, DigiCert, in its sole discretion, may or may not respond to Feedback or promise to address any Feedback in the development of future features or functionalities of the Services. In the event DigiCert uses Feedback in any way, Customer hereby grants DigiCert an unrestricted, perpetual, worldwide, exclusive, transferable, irrevocable, sublicensable, royalty-free, fully paid-up license to use, copy, modify, create derivative works of, make, have made, distribute (through multiple tiers of distribution), publicly perform or display, import, export, sell, offer to sell, rent, or license copies of the Feedback as part of or in connection with any DigiCert product, service (including the Services), technology, content, material, specification or Documentation. For the avoidance doubt, Customer will not obtain any title, interest, or ownership right to the Services in connection with any Feedback.

*4.4* *Trademark Usage.*  Customer agrees that DigiCert may use Customer's name and trademark to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to indicate that Customer is receiving DigiCert's Service, provided that such use would not foreseeably diminish or damage Customer's rights in any of its trademarks, create a misrepresentation of the parties' relationship, or diminish or damage a party's reputation. Neither party may register or claim any right in the other party's trademarks. Customer grants DigiCert the right to use any trademark of Customer included in the Certificate to the extent necessary to operate such Certificate.

*4.5* *Customer Content.*  Customer retains all right, title and interest in and to its Customer Content.

## 5. Additional Terms Applicable to the Services.

*5.1* *On-Premises Software.*  If Customer's use of any Service (or component thereof) includes the use of DigiCert's On-Premises Software, then subject to Customer's compliance with this Agreement and any restrictions that DigiCert may impose on where such On-Premises Software can be installed, DigiCert hereby grants to Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use, reproduce and install a reasonable number of copies of the On-Premises Software on Customer's hardware, equipment or devices, solely in connection with Customer's use of the Services that the On-Premises Software is provided in connection with. Any updates to the On-Premises Software provided by DigiCert at its sole discretion shall be subject to any terms and conditions provided with such updates. If no terms and conditions are provided, then such updates are subject to this Agreement. Any such updates may affect Customer's product and may require Customer to make changes to Customer's product in order to maintain interoperability.

*5.2* *Third Party Services.*  DigiCert may make third-party services and websites ("**Third-Party Services**"), including any separately downloadable or accessible add-on, plug-in, module, command, function, playbook, content, suite or application that extends the features or functionality of the applicable Service, available for download or access as a convenience to its customers. DigiCert makes no promises or guarantees related to any Third-Party Service and will not be liable for any such Third-Party Service. Nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to be a representation or warranty by DigiCert with respect to any Third-Party Service. DigiCert may, in its reasonable discretion, block or disable access to any Third-Party Service at any time without notice or liability. Customer's use of a Third-Party Service is at its own risk and may be subject to additional terms and conditions applicable to that Third-Party Service (such as license terms of the providers of such Third-Party Service). In addition, the On-Premises Software may contain third party software programs that are available under open source or free software licenses, and this Agreement does not alter any rights or obligations Customer may have under those open source or free software licenses and DigiCert makes no promises or guarantees related to such third-party software.

*5.3* *Third Party Content.*  The Services may contain features or functions that enable interoperation with Third-Party Content that Customer, in its sole discretion, chooses to use in connection with a Service. Customer may be required to obtain access to such Third-Party Content from the respective providers, and Customer may be required to grant DigiCert access to Customer's accounts with such providers to the extent necessary for DigiCert to allow the interoperation with the Services. By requesting or allowing DigiCert to enable access to such Third-Party Content in connection with the Services, Customer represents and warrants that it is authorized under the provider's terms to allow such access. If Customer installs or enables (or directs or otherwise authorizes DigiCert to install or enable) Third-Party Content for use with the Services where the interoperation includes access by the third-party provider of Customer Content or Customer's Confidential Information, Customer hereby authorizes DigiCert to allow the provider of such Third-Party Content to access Customer Content or Customer's Confidential Information as necessary for interoperation. Customer agrees that DigiCert is not responsible or liable for disclosure, modification, or deletion of Customer Content resulting from access to Customer Content by such Third-Party Content, nor is DigiCert liable for any damages or downtime that Customer may incur or any impact on Customer's experience of the Services, directly or indirectly, as a result of Customer's use of or reliance on any Third-Party Content, sites or resources.

However, an Indemnified Party's failure to notify will not relieve the indemnifying party from its indemnification obligations, except to the extent that the failure to notify materially prejudices the indemnifying party. The indemnifying party may assume the defense of any proceeding requiring indemnification unless assuming the defense would result in potential conflicting interests as determined by the Indemnified Party in good faith. An Indemnified Party may, at the indemnifying party's expense, defend itself until the indemnifying party's counsel has initiated a defense of the Indemnified Party. Even after the indemnifying party assumes the defense, the Indemnified Party may participate in any proceeding using counsel of its own choice and at its own expense. The indemnifying party may not settle any proceeding related to this Agreement unless the settlement also includes an unconditional release of liability for all Indemnified Parties. The indemnifying party's indemnification obligations hereunder are not an Indemnified Party's sole remedy for events giving rise to indemnity by the indemnifying party hereunder and are in addition to any other remedies an Indemnified Party may have against the indemnifying party under this Agreement.

*8.7* *Injunctive Relief.*  Customer acknowledges that its breach of this Agreement may result in irreparable harm to DigiCert that cannot adequately be redressed by damages. Accordingly, in addition to any other legal remedies which may be available, DigiCert may seek and obtain an injunctive order against a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by Customer, and without a need to post a bond or similar action.

*8.8* *Extent.*  The limitations and obligations in this section apply to the maximum extent permitted by law and apply regardless of: *(i)* the reason for or nature of the liability, including tort claims; *(ii)* the number of claims of liability; *(iii)* the extent or nature of the damages; or *(iv)* whether any other provisions of this Agreement were breached or proven ineffective.

## 9.  Miscellaneous.

*9.1* *Force Majeure.*  Except for Customer's payment obligations, neither party is liable for any failure or delay in performing its obligations under this Agreement to the extent that the circumstances causing such failure or delay are beyond a party's reasonable control. Customer acknowledges that the Services (including the Portal and Certificates) are subject to the operation and telecommunication infrastructures of the Internet and the operation of Customer's Internet connection services, all of which are beyond DigiCert's control.

*9.2* *Entire Agreement.*  This Agreement, along with all documents referred to herein, including any applicable Order Form, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter, superseding all other prior agreements that might exist. The Services are provided only upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Service Specific Terms, and this Agreement prevails over any conflicting, additional, or different terms and conditions proposed by Customer in any other documentation. Any terms and conditions contained in any purchase order, click-through agreement, or other documentation issued by Customer, before or after the Effective Date, and that may require affirmative acceptance of such terms and conditions by DigiCert as part of a vendor set-up process or otherwise, are expressly rejected and will have no effect. Except as otherwise allowed herein, neither party may amend this Agreement unless the amendment is in writing and signed by the parties. In the event of an inconsistency between documents, the following order of precedence will apply: (1) this Agreement, (2) Service Specific Terms; (3) other applicable appendices, addenda, and schedules, and (4) Order Forms, unless the Order Form expressly states that it will take precedence.

*9.3* *Amendment.*  DigiCert may amend: *(i)* the Service Specific Terms; *(ii)* the Privacy Policy; and *(iii)* any other applicable appendices, addenda and schedules (but for clarity not an Order Form) at any time and will give notice of any material changes via the Portal, by posting the amended version to the Legal Repository, or by a means set forth in Section 9.7. If such an amendment materially and adversely affects Customer's rights herein, Customer will have the right, as its sole and exclusive remedy in connection with such amendment, to terminate this Agreement during the 30-day period after DigiCert's notice of such amendment, by providing written notice of termination to DigiCert. Customer's continued use of the Services after 30 days of DigiCert's notice of the amendment constitutes Customer's acceptance of the amendment.

*9.4* *Waiver.*  A party's failure to enforce or delay in enforcing a provision of this Agreement does not waive the party's right to enforce the same provision later or the party's right to enforce any other provision of this Agreement. A waiver is only effective if in writing and signed by both parties.

*9.5* *Assignment.*  Customer may not assign or delegate any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of DigiCert. DigiCert may assign or delegate any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement without Customer's consent. Any purported assignment or delegation in violation of this Agreement is null and void.

*9.6* *Relationship.*  DigiCert and Customer are independent contractors and not agents or employees of each other. Neither party has the power to bind or obligate the other or to make any statements, representations, warranties or commitments on behalf of the other party. Each party is responsible for its own expenses and employees. All persons employed by a party will be employees of such party and not of the other party and all costs and obligations incurred by reason of any such employment will be for the account and expense of such party.

*9.7* *Notices.* DigiCert will send notices of early termination or breach of this Agreement to Customer by first class mail to the address listed in the Portal Account, which notices are effective upon receipt. DigiCert will send all other notices (or if no physical address is provided by Customer, then DigiCert will send all notices hereunder including notices of early termination or breach of this Agreement) by posting the notice in the Portal Account or by email via the email address of Customer's administrator in the Portal Account (or other alternate email address associated with the Portal Account if provided), or by regular mail. All such notices are effective when posted in the Portal or when sent to the Portal Account. It is Customer's responsibility to keep its email address current. Customer will be deemed to have received any email sent to the email address then associated with the Portal Account when DigiCert sends the email, regardless of whether Customer receives the email. Customer will send DigiCert notices in writing by postal mail that is addressed to DigiCert, Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 2801 North Thanksgiving Way, Suite 500, Lehi, Utah 84043. Notices from Customer are effective upon receipt. DigiCert may change its address for notice either by providing written (including email) notice to Customer or by publishing a new address for notice through the Portal.

*9.8* *Governing Law and Jurisdiction.*  The *(i)* laws that govern the interpretation, construction, and enforcement of this Agreement and all matters, claims or disputes related to it, including tort claims, and *(ii)* the courts or arbitration bodies that have exclusive jurisdiction over any of the matters, claims or disputes contemplated in sub-section *(i)* above, will each depend on where Customer is domiciled, as set forth in the table below; provided, for clarity, that rights and obligations arising from applicable local laws continue to be governed by such laws, including with respect to EU Regulation 910/2014 (eIDAS), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and trade compliance laws. In instances where the International Chamber of Commerce is designated below as the court or arbitration body with exclusive jurisdiction of such matters, claims or disputes, then the parties hereby agree that (x) all matters, claims or disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce ("**Rules**") by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the Rules, (y) judgment on the award rendered by such arbitration may be entered in any court having jurisdiction, and (z) this arbitration clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.

Both Customer and DigiCert shall make good faith efforts to resolve such dispute via business discussions. If the dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after the initial notice, then a party may proceed as permitted under applicable law and as specified under this Agreement.

*(i)* *Arbitration.* In the event a dispute is allowed or required under this agreement to be resolved through arbitration, the parties will maintain the confidential nature of the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, a judicial confirmation or challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or judicial decision.

*(ii)* *Class Action and Jury Trial Waiver.* THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL FOR THE PURPOSES OF LITIGATING DISPUTES HEREUNDER.

The parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum in connection with any dispute. If the dispute is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.
